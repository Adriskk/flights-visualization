**Adison#5555** submission for **Timathon 2021 (Mar-Apr)** - [vote for me](#)

An application which shows the current USA map with
thousands of aircrafts markers, containing some features regarding to planes. 



## Features
1. [Separate data for each aircraft]()
2. [Saving map ready for any use]()
3. [Get the exact position of clicked plane]()
4. [Calculate the aircrafts aggregate on map using Machine Learning]()



## Installation

You can easily download and set it up when following the instructions
on [this repository](https://github.com/openskynetwork/opensky-api).
You need to install the modules from **requirements.txt** file, too.

```

or 

```bash
python3 visualize.py
```

in cmd 


## About
Move on the map and discover aircrafts nearby. By clicking on the plane marker you can learn more about clicked
plane like current position, speed, update time and heading direction. App uses K-Means Machine Learning algorithm to find the aggregate of 
aircrafts on the map. Sometimes application takes some time to load the map becouse of a API request and data preprocessing
